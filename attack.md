### Attack type
There are 3 general types of attack cards, Pass, Run and Kick. 

#### Common Parts
Every card has a "Tempo Movement section". This determines what direction and distance that all the attacking player tokens will move.
The direction is either forward and diagonal left/right. The player can choose to move each token either in the direction of the card or not at all.

> This mechanic is trying to resolve an issue where being able to move every piece would take too much time, but the moving around of every piece is nessary for them.
> I definitely need to work heavily on this concept as I think it is key to the trade of on complexity, abstraction and duration.

#### Strength

Generally the success of the action is determined by comparing to the stength and nature of the attacker and defenders card.

> The exact details of this still need work. It should not always be the best to play the highest strength card.

#### Pass
This card moves the ball from the current player token to another friendly player token. 
It has a modifer noting how many player tokens must be skipped to determine who the pass goes too. 

> Definitely need an example here

It also includes a number representing how faster the pass it.
The pass can be left or right of the player token with the ball.

>Which player token does the defenders card apply to is important here.

#### Run
This card represents the play carrier charging forward with the ball, attempting to break through or go around the defense.
