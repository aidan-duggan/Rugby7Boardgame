# Phases of play

## Kick off

## Ruck/Tackle
Play will mainly revolve around [rucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_gameplay#Ruck), this is in our case when a player with the ball has been tackled. 
We'll not worry about the actual requirement for more players to be involved at the moment.

> Should there be a mechanic to represent the contest of a ruck? or can this be considered part of another mechanic?

> We'll ignore how the first ruck forms form here on for now.

Once the ruck has formed the ball is available for the nearest friendly player token. All opposing tokens most begin to retreat behind the line the ruck forms.

The attacking and defending players then draws 3 cards from their respective decks.

> There is some time between the tackle/ruck and the first player arriving, I need to think about what happens here

The main aspect of play happens now. 

The attacking player must secretly and in order select the cards that make up their attacking play, minimum 1.

Then the defending player selects an equal number of cards to defend with.

> Since the attacking player decides the number of cards played, they could force the defender to play everything. 
> This is a stable state (draw 3 play all 3) so the resulting behaviour should be carefully analyzed.
> This should favour the defender for sure, to encourage the attack to simple kick the ball to the defender for a gain in territory
> This could be achieved by when play shifts from player to player the new attack gains cards depending on how long they defended.

Then the cards are resolved. This is detailed in the Resolution of Play section.
