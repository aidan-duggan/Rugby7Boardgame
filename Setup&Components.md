# Setup and Components

# Components

The game will consist roughly of:
  14 player tokens (7 each side)
  1 ball token
  2 score tokens
  2 decks of cards (attack and defense)
  1 board

## Tokens
Tokens will be standard fair.

## Board
Board will be a replica of a rugby pitch. It will divided in a square grid at least 14 squares across. I'm not sure on the depth, this will clearly have a large impact on play time but too shallow could look silly.

## Cards
There are two main desks, attack and defense. The details of each card will be outlines in their respective sections.

## Kick Off Setup

The game always starts with a Kick Off, and after a score. The scoring player is the kicker in the kick off.

> Kick off is a very messy thing, an abstraction might be a better solution then modeling it. It would make for a cleaner introduction also.
> That said it is interesting to play it out, perhaps it could be an optional rule?

The kicking player places their player tokens where they want on their side of the pitch. Then the recieving player places their tokens. The attacking player then chooses where to kick the ball.
