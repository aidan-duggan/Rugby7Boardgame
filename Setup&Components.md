# Setup and Components

# Components

The game will consist roughly of:
  14 player tokens (7 each side)
  1 ball token
  2 score tokens
  2 decks of cards (attack and defense)
  1 board

## Tokens
Tokens will be standard fair.

## Board
Board will be a replica of a rugby pitch. It will divided in a square grid at least 14 squares across. I'm not sure on the depth, this will clearly have a large impact on play time but too shallow could look silly.

## Cards
There are two main desks, attack and defense. The details of each card will be outlines in their respective sections.
