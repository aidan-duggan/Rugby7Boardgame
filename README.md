# Rugby7Boardgame
Rules for a work in progress Rugby 7s boardgame

## Intro

People manage their code through github, some people have written books through github, why not build up boardgame rules through it?

The site will record my creation of a boardgame based on [Rugby 7s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens). I first started documenting my idea on [my blog](http://aidan-duggan.github.io/whilegaming/2017-02-27-idea3) 

I'm not going to start with a very structured aim, instead I'm going to start documenting very basic ideas for rules and record my thoughts on their evolution.

*This is all very much a work in progress!!*
