Each player has both a deck of cards and an active deck. While defending they are drawing cards from their main deck to their active deck. 
This could allow giving the attack more choice without actually having more cards to use since cards are both resources and choices. When cards are draw it could be up to the player if it goes on top or on the bottom of the active deck. Definitely want to keep the game fast enough.

Tempo cards, attacker has a card with numbers and symbols. These are revealed in order when a defender beats an attacker and decides what the impact is. Early numbers should generally be safe. Also doing the right action at exactly the right time should provide a bonus. Cards will be played at each set piece and will be used to determine the success or failure of the set piece. Not 100% sure how it applies to defense at the moment. It also gives the attacker more to do further imbalancing the enjoyment of the defender. It does provide more control for the rules to speed up the game and force play to switch from attack to defense. I think this is the way to go for sure, a much better abstraction of exhaustion and tempo, and simplifiers the resolution of actions.
