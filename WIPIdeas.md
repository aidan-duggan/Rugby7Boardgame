Each player has both a deck of cards and an active deck. While defending they are drawing cards from their main deck to their active deck. 
This could allow giving the attack more choice without actually having more cards to use since cards are both resources and choices. When cards are draw it could be up to the player if it goes on top or on the bottom of the active deck. Definitely want to keep the game fast enough.
